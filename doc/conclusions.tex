\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this paper, we have presented a system that makes the power of SMT more
available to programmers than ever before. We have demonstrated that integrating
SMT-LIB with Racket lets users do more and build abstractions on top, letting
users grow the language according to their needs.

Our implementation is open source and freely available at

\end{center}

\texttt{z3.rkt} is still a work in progress, and in the near term we hope to
achieve

\begin{itemize}
\item Support for more of Z3, including external theories and procedure
  abstractions
\item New abstractions built on top, guided by practical use cases
\item Work on model checking and debugging functional programs
\item Possible integration with other SMT solvers
\end{itemize}

In the long term, we hope the community will find this system useful and
contribute to the project.
