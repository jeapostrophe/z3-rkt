\begin{abstract}
 We present a system that integrates Z3 SMT solver with
 Racket programming language. The system defines a programmer's
 interface in Racket that makes it easy to harness the power
 of Z3 to discover solutions to logical constraints. The
 interface format, although in Racket, retains the structure
 and brevity of SMT-LIB format, thereby making it trivial to
 translate SMT-LIB programs to it. The integration of Z3
 with Racket is useful for many applications like debugging,
 program verification, and automatic test generation. We
 provide some examples of the proposed usages.

\section{Introduction}
We present a system that integrates Z3 SMT solver~\cite{z3} with
Racket programming language~\cite{racket}. The integrated
system allows the user to embed logical constraints in a
Racket program, thus assisting in program verification,
debugging, automatic test generation and related
applications.

\subsection{Why z3.rkt? A Motivating Example}

SMT solvers are powerful tools and can solve a wide variety of problems using
efficient heuristics, yet they're only used by a small number of experts. It
isn't hard to see why: the usual way for programs to interact with SMT solvers
like Z3~\cite{z3}, Yices~\cite{yices} and CVC3~\cite{cvc3} is via relatively
arcane C APIs. For example, here's a C program that
