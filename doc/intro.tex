\begin{abstract}
 We present a system that integrates Z3 SMT solver with
 Racket programming language. The system defines a programmer's
 interface in Racket that makes it easy to harness the power
 of Z3 to discover solutions to logical constraints. The
 interface format, although in Racket, retains the structure
 and brevity of SMT-LIB format, thereby making it trivial to
 translate SMT-LIB programs to it. The integration of Z3
 with Racket is useful for many applications like debugging,
 program verification, and automatic test generation. We
 provide some examples of the proposed usages.
